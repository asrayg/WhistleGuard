# WhistleGuard - README

## This was for the Iowa State University Hack Club's Mini Hackathon. This was more focused on making designs and how an app targeted college students would look like.

## Introduction

**WhistleGuard** is your all-in-one safety app designed to help prevent and report sexual assault (SA) in real-time. While we can't stop SA from happening, we can provide tools to enhance personal safety and ensure faster reporting and support.

## Features

WhistleGuard offers three key features aimed at providing security and peace of mind:

1. **Loud Rape Whistle & Emergency Dispatch:**
   - Blow the whistle to trigger a loud screeching sound.
   - Automatically calls 911.
   - Notifies the university police dispatcher.
   - Nearby cameras are checked to provide quicker response.
   - Texts are sent to people in the vicinity using cellular towers to triangulate your location.

2. **Virtual Walk Back with a Dispatcher:**
   - If you feel unsafe walking home, you can request a university dispatcher to walk with you virtually and monitor your route until you reach home safely.
   - Simply input your phone number and the time needed for the walk.

3. **Fake Phone Call from Your Partner:**
   - If you find yourself in an uncomfortable situation or conversation, you can schedule a fake phone call from an AI agent acting as your partner, giving you an excuse to leave.
   - Input your phone number and the time for when you want the call.

## University-Specific Collaboration

WhistleGuard is tailored specifically for university use, collaborating with both the university and city police forces. In order to use the app's full features, you must have a verified university email account.

## Registration

1. **University Verification**: Register using your university email.
2. **Verification Process**: After inputting your email, you will receive a confirmation to verify your account.
   
Currently available at **Iowa State University**.

## Safety and Prevention

WhistleGuard is designed to keep you safe:
- **Immediate Reporting**: When the whistle is blown, emergency services are notified immediately, and help is sent faster through camera surveillance and location triangulation.
- **Virtual Support**: If you're feeling unsafe, get virtual assistance from university dispatchers to ensure you arrive home safely.
- **Escape Uncomfortable Situations**: The fake phone call feature helps you exit awkward or unsafe situations with ease.

## How to Use

1. **Blow the Whistle**: Trigger the loud noise and alert authorities with a simple blow.
2. **Request Virtual Walk**: Input your phone number and set the time for a virtual walk with a dispatcher.
3. **Schedule a Fake Call**: Provide your phone number and the time for an AI agent to call you, posing as your partner.

## Important Note

If you are in immediate danger, always call 911 directly.

WhistleGuard is here to provide additional support and protection in situations where you feel unsafe. Stay safe with WhistleGuard!
